# python-pandas-matplotlib-office

Purpose: Create a visualization using matplotlib's scatter plot that displays episode number, the viewership, the fan rating, and guest apprearance in "The Office".

Tools: User-defined functions with Pandas; scantter plot with matplotlib.

Results: I was able to put 4D data (episode number, viewership, ratings, and guest appreanrace) on a 2D graph. Guest appreances don't necessarily affect the viewership or ratings.
